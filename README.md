# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

**Author:** Hyndavi Bejjenki

## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to **predict customer churn** in the telecom sector using **Logistic Regression**. Customer churn is a crucial business problem, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal is to analyze customer data, identify key factors contributing to churn, and build a predictive model to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.
